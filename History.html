      <img src="Images/logo1.png" alt="logo">
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Initially our Trustees Dr. Shaikh Khalid Subhan and Dr. Sardar Mukhtar Ahmed thought about
establishing an English Medium School specially for the minority communities irrespective of caste
or religion. They wanted that the parents who want to educate their children in English medium but
who can not afford to pay heavy fees and other expenses, should get an opportunity to educate
their children in English Medium for which the expenses should be within their financial capabilities.
These two trustees then selected and added five more trustees and formed 'Igra Education and
Welfare Society.</p>
<p>We seven trustees then established Iqra School under the control of said society as was
envisaged by Dr. Shaikh Khalid and Dr. Sardar M.A. This was the year 1995.
We had no financial help from anybody and no place or building to start the school. So we
approached the trustees of the shrine of saint Shah Masoom for acquiring some rooms to start
with in the premises of the said shrine. The trustees specially Alhaj Shaikh Subhanbhai Cutlery
and Alhaj Muzaffar Khan alias Babubhai helped a lot and we got four small rooms which were used
as classrooms from nursury to Lower K.G. and Upper K.G.</p>
<p>Dr. Sardar Mukhtar Ahmed, M.Sc., Ph.D. has a long experience as a very successful and
one of the most efficient professors of his subject. He selected two persons as trustees from his
own field of education. One is Prof. Shaikh Mohammad Sayeed an Ex-Professor of English from
Ahmednagar College, Ahmednagar and an ex-secretary of A.T.U. Chand Sultana High School and
Junior College, an institution of very long and firm standing and one of the poineer institutions of
Maharashtra state. The other person is myself, Dr. Sultan Khan having four post graduate degrees
and Ph.D. I am an ex-reader in education from Marathwada College of Education, Aurangabad.
Dr. Shaikh Khalid a very successful medical practitioner selected three more trustees. Alhaj
sayed Iqbal A. Gafoor, a civil engineer and a renowned personality in the field of construction of
buildings. Alhaj Khokar. Abdur Raheem Gous Mohammad from the famous family of Govt. Contrac
tors Haji Jamal and Sons. He is a contracter as well as owner of shops of spare parts of heavy
vehicles. Mr. Qazi Viquarali Sadiqueali a skillful architect who is famous for his designs of various
types of buildings and interior decoration.</p>
<p>Our society was initially headed by Prof. S. M. Sayeed Sir as a Chaiman. All the trustees
stood united and worked hard and honestly and took personal interest in the development and
progress of Igra English Medium School. Initailly the foundation of the school was firmly and suc-
cessfully laid by Dr. Sardar M.A. This team work bore fruits. The Igra school was started with noble
and high aims and objectives. It was a challanging job as the community for which the school was
established lacks interest and inclination towards education. Majority of parents are just literate and
many of them are illiterate, though a sufficient number of them is educated. We have a double task of educating children as well as their parents. Still by the Grace of God Igra School travelled step
by step towards higher and brighter horizons. The trustees had to go door to door for convincing
the parents and guardians to send their children to an English Medium school.</p>
<p>In June 1999 we could acquire recogntion from Government to our school. By this time there
were classes upto third standard. We formed small classes accommodating on an average 25 stu-
dents only in order to maintain class discipline and to pay individual attention to students. Now the
strength of students rose from 35 to 220. (This was the result of efforts and struggle by the mem-
bers of the management and teachers and with the cooperation and help from well wishers and friends
from the city, who initially donated money according to their status and interest,
Our joumey towards success continued. In 1999 we acquired a bigger premises on rent of
Rs. 17 thousands per month. We were getting support and encouragement, from the parents and
well wishers.</p>
<p>At the time of shifting the school from Shah Masoom Shrine to the bigger rented building we
arranged a function and invited Hon. P.A. Inamdar Saheb, Hon. Merchant Abdus Sattar, President of
Haji Ali Trust, Mumbai and other dignitaries. In this programme Hon. P.A. Inamdar Saheb encouraged
us to continue towards imparting quality education only. He initiated and promised maximum pos-
sible help and cooperation in our task. Hon. Merchant saheb also encouraged us by promising to
support us in our struggle. We are very grateful to all such supporters and wellwishers.
With the passage of time the number of students were increasing and the rented building
was falling short to accommodate the students. We were trying to acquire a sufficiently big plot of
land. We approached some trusts which possessed vast lands but we could not succeed in acquir-
ing a plot for school building. Then some of our trustees collected funds by contribution in which
following trustees lent money for this purpose : Dr. Shaikh Khalid Rs. 50,000/- (2) Er. Sayed Iqbal
As. 50,000/- for (3) Dr. Sultan Khan Rs. 25,000/- and (4) Mr. Qazi Viqar Rs. 25,000/-
We purahased 4 Plots adjacent to a land of 1-5 acre which was reserved for a playground
by the Municipal Corporation. With the help of some wellwishers specially the then connciller Shri
Jayant Yelulkar, the then President of Municipal Corporation Hon. Mrs. Lata Lodha granted permis-
sion to use this land as a playground for Iqra school. This achievement helped us in winning confi-
dence of the philanthropists like Hon. P.A. Inamdar and Hon. Munawar Peerbhoy and their co-work-
ers and other trustees.</p>
<p>Specially Hon. P.A. Inamdar Saheb encouraged us by donating funds from Maharashtra Cos-
mopolitan Education society and Haji Gulam Mohammad Azam Trust, Pune of which the chairman is
Hon. Munawwar Peerbhai. These patrons helped us in getting loan from the Muslim Cooperative Bank,
Sangamner Branch, also.</p>
<p>Hon. P.A. Inamdar Sahab rendered maximum guidance and help in the erection of the present
gigantic and beautiful building. It came out to be a unique school building with all the necessary edu-
cational facilities to the students. It is a pride to our community and city, and a permanent place for
imparting education to the students specially from Ahmednagar.</p>
