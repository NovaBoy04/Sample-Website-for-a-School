	<p id="top">In the name of Allah the most beneficent & merciful.</p>
	<p>I am grateful to Allah who made me a part of this landmark of school, a Silver Jubilee year
	2019-20. At this movement I feel that I should describe 25 years journey of this institution. I lay
	before you a brief account of thejourney.</p><p>
	It was the time when some renowned English medium schools were very much negative to
	grantadmission to Muslim children. Also heavy fees of English medium school were not affordable
	for small earning Muslim parents. Almighty Allah brought like mined personalities Dr. Shaikh
	Khalid Subhan and Pro. Sardar Mukhtar Ahmed together and both took initiative to establish a
	school for all caste. Later on Er. Sayyed Iqbal, Er. Kazi Viqarali, Prof. Dr. Sultan Khan, Prof. S.M.
	Sayeed and myself joined these hands. We seven members formed "Iqra Education and Welfare
	Trust, Ahmednagar. Prof. S.M. Sayeed was chosen as the first chairman of the trust. This trust on ist
	June 1995 instituted a school named "Iqra English Medium School." In order to pursuit admission
	we went door to door and enrolled 35 students for pre-primary classes. We had no funds or building
	to impart education so in want of building we approached the trustee of Hazrat Shah Masoom
	Darga, which is located at Panchpeer Chawdi, Near Muncipal Office, Ahmednagar.</p><p>
	The trust granted four rooms where we started our school. All trustees in spite of their busy
	schedule worked hard with sincerity to develop the school. A great support from the parents raised
	the student strength to 220 so the place where school was being run fell short. Meanwhile in 1999
	the school got recognition from the Govt. of Maharashtra, In the Year 1997 wetook bigger place Old
	Ayurvedic Hospital Building situated at Maliwada on rental basis of Rs. 17000/- P.M. At the time of
	shifting the school from Shah Masoom Dargah to Old Ayurvedic Hospital Building We had
	arranged a function and invited Hon. Dr. P.A. Inamdar Saheband other dignitaries. On the occasion
	Hon. P. A.Inamdar Saheb encouraged us to continueservices in the field of education.</p><p>
	He promised us to support in every possible way. As the strength of school was growing year
	after year, We thought to have our own building. In pursuit of this we approached some trusts
	(NGOS) of Ahmednagar. Who were possessing vast lands, but all was in vain. This disappointed us,
	but our trustees contributes Rs. 1,50,000/- and purchased four plots where today's gigantic,beautiful school is standing.
	Adjacent to these plots there was acre open space of Ahmednagar Mahapalika. With the kind support of then councillor Shri. Jayant Yelulkar and then President
	of Mahapalika Smt. Lata Lodha, the Ahmednagar Mahapalika granted this land to ourschool to
	be used as Play ground. Hon. Dr.P.A.Inamdar Saheb supported us by donating Rs.75,00,000/-
	from his organization Maharashtra cosmopolitian society, and Haji Gulam Mohammed Azam
	Trust, Pune.</p><p>
	He also helped us getting loan from Muslim Co-operative Bank Sangamner Branch.P.A.
	Inamdar Sir rendered maximum guidance and helped in building this magnificent and
	beautiful school building. Our patron was admired by everyone over the city. So our trust
	unanimously decided to rename Iqra English Medium School as "P.A. Inamdar English Medium
	School". By May 2005 the new building was complete. So the school which was being run at Old
	Ayurvedic College, Ahmednagar shifted to present building in June 2005. The renaming
	ceremony was organized on 24/12/2005. It will be unjustified if I don't mention names of Hon.
	Madam Abeda Inamdar, Hon. Munnawwar Peerbhoy and Ar. Shaikh Zuber Saheb, all close
	associates of P.A. Inamdar sir from Pune. Who supported us in every possible way. The
	management unanimously awarded Life Membership to Hon. Dr. P.A. Inamdar, Hon. Madam
	Abeda Inamdar, Hon. Munawwar Peerboy and Ar. Shaikh Zuber. Thus the strength of trustees
	raised to eleven from seven.</p><p>
	Today the school is well set with modern technologies like Computer training and E
	Class teaching. Our teachers and supportive staff is working hard for the upliftment of the
	students.</p><p>
	In this journey of two and half decades we lost two trustees namely. Dr. Sultan Khan
	Saheb and Prof. S.M. Sayeed Saheb. We also lost devoted and dedicated Principal Sabiha
	madam and Asst. Teacher Mumtaz Arif Shaikh. This was the irreparable loss to the institution. I
	pray Almighty Allah to grant these noblesouls abode in the heaven. Ameen.</p><p>
	Before I conclude I thank all members of management, Principal, Vice Principal,
	Teachers and Non Teaching staff of today & past for their diligent, sincere and honest work
	toward the institution.</p><p>
	I pray Allah to give us strength to serve the institution better than before I am sure with
	the help of my colleagues, Staff members, Parents and well wishers the school will reach to
	high realm of excellence.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Thank You.</p>
